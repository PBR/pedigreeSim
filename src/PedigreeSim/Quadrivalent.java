    /**
     * doCrossingOver performs crossing-over for a cross-type Quadrivalent.
     * First we define 8 new HaploStructs ("slots") to represent the chromatids,
     * each with just one segment of one of four pseudo-founderalleles.
     * The four chromosomes are each composed of 2 chromatids ("slots"),
     * 0+1, 2+3, 4+5 and 6+7.
     * Picture the Quadrivalent as a cross, with a left, up, right and down arm.
     * In each arm two of the chromosome ends are paired as follows:
     * left arm: start of slots 0,1,6,7
     * up arm: end of slots 0,1,2,3
     * right arm: start of slots 2,3,4,5
     * down arm: end of slots 4,5,6,7
     * (in the following we say that the up and down arms are the "opposing
     * arms" of the left and right arms, and v.v.)
     * We define 3 doCrossingOver methods for a cross-type Quadrivalent:
     * 1. Chiasmata are generated from the ends of each arm, until they
     * conflict with an existing chiasma in an opposite arm or are located
     * beyond the opposite end. When a conflicting chiasma has occurred
     * no new chiasmata are generated for that arm, but in the other arms
     * the process continues, until in all arms a conflicting chiasma has 
     * occurred.
     * 2. Chiasmata are generated from the ends of each arm until the first
     * conflict occurs. A conflict can occur because:
     * 2a. the new chiasma is beyond the opposite end of the chromosome
     * (this is only possible if no chiasmata have occurred in the two opposing 
     * arms, else situation 2b applies).
     * In this case in effect there are two bivalents, and for one of these
     * bivalents the crossing-over process has just finished.
     * Implementation: if the arm has the chromosome start, then the
     * exhangeStart becomes chromosomeEnd, exchangeEnd was already chromosomeEnd
     * and armFinished is true for this arm. Valid chiasmata can only be 
     * generated in the other arm that has also the chromosome start; until 
     * here also a chiasma is generated beyond the chromosomeEnd.
     * 2b. the new chiasma is beyond the nearest chiasma in one of the two
     * opposing arms. In that case the chromosome exchange point is now fixed
     * at that chiasma position and no new chiasmata can be generated in the
     * two arms involved in the conflict. In the other two arms further chiasmata
     * are generated until they conflict with the exchange point.
     * Implementation: if the current arm has the chromosome start, the
     * exchangeStart and exchangeEnd are now set to the position of the 
     * conflicting chiasma and no more chiasmata can be generated in these
     * two arms.
     * 2c. the new chiasma is generated on before the nearest chiasma on the
     * two opposing arm, but close to it and due to interference it is conflicting
     * (this can only occur when popdata.chiasmaInterference is true). In that
     * case no new chiasmata are generated for this arm, but the failed
     * chiasma defines the new start point of the chromosome exchange interval.
     * Implementation: if the current arm has the chromosome start,
     * exchangeStart is set to the failed position and armFinished is
     * true.
     * 2d. the new chiasma is generated beyond the position of a previous
     * conflicting chiasma as discussed in 2c, but not conflicting with
     * an actual chiasma. Then the start of the exchange interval is
     * moved to that position, which is also the end of the interval
     * Implementation: if the current arm has the chromosome start, then 
     * this situation occurs if no conflicts with opposing chiasmata occur
     * but the new chiasma is beyond exchangeEnd. Now exchangeStart is set
     * to exchangeEnd and armFinished is true. This is the same as what
     * happens in situation 2a.
     * The reasoning behind method 2 (a, b and c) is that in order to generate
     * a chiasma, even if it conflicts, the pairing of the chromosomes in that
     * arm must already have been completed up to that point or up to the 
     * chromosome exchange point.
     * QUESTION: does the chromosome exchange point cause interference like
     * a chiasma? 
     * ANSWER: that depends on whether the interference is mainly caused by the
     * mechanical bending stress (then: yes) or mainly by the break/repair
     * process (then: no). But a practical consideration is that it is often
     * not precisely known where the exchange point is, so interference
     * cannot be modelled.
     * 3. Chiasmata are generated from the ends of each arm until the first
     * conflict occurs. When this happens the crossing-over process is
     * ended for the complete quadrivalent.
     * This seems to be too stringent: the amount of recombination at the
     * ends of the arms is about half that in a bivalent.     
     * @return a HaploStruct[] with 8 elements: the 8 recombined chromatids,
     * (the slots) still in the original order.
