     * doCrossingOver performs crossing-over for a cross-type Quadrivalent.
     * First we define 8 new HaploStructs ("slots") to represent the chromatids,
     * each with just one segment of one of four pseudo-founderalleles.
     * The four chromosomes are each composed of 2 chromatids ("slots"),
     * 0+1, 2+3, 4+5 and 6+7.
     * Picture the Quadrivalent as a cross, with a left, up, right and down arm.
     * In each arm two of the chromosome ends are paired as follows:
     * left arm (0): head of slots 0,1,6,7
     * up arm (1): tail of slots 0,1,2,3
     * right arm (2): head of slots 2,3,4,5
     * down arm (3): tail of slots 4,5,6,7
     * (in the following we say that the up and down arms are the "opposing
     * arms" of the left and right arms, and v.v.)
     * We define 3 doCrossingOver methods for a cross-type Quadrivalent,
     * which are selected by popdata.quadriMethod = 1/2/3:
     * 1. (implemented in testChiasma13):
     * Chiasmata are generated from the ends of each arm, until they
     * conflict with an existing chiasma in an opposite arm or are located
     * beyond the opposite end. When a conflicting chiasma has occurred
     * no new chiasmata are generated for that arm, but in the other arms
     * the process continues, until in all arms a conflicting chiasma has 
     * occurred. This would mean that a conflict affects only the arm from which
     * the next chiasma was attempted but not the arm in which the conflicting
     * chiasma is located.
     * 2. (implemented in testChiasma2):
     * Chiasmata are generated from the ends of each arm until the first
     * conflict occurs. A conflict can occur because:
     * 2a. the new chiasma is beyond the opposite end of the chromosome
     * (this is only possible if no chiasmata have occurred in the two opposing 
     * arms, else situation 2b applies). - "reason 1" in testChiasma2
     * In this case in effect there are two bivalents, and for one of these
     * bivalents the crossing-over process has just finished.
     * 2b. the new chiasma is beyond the nearest chiasma in one of the two
     * opposing arms. In that case the chromosome exchange point is now fixed
     * at that chiasma position and no new chiasmata can be generated in the
     * two arms involved in the conflict. In the other two arms further chiasmata
     * are generated until they conflict with the exchange point. - "reason 2" 
     * in testChiasma2
     * 2c. the new chiasma is generated before the nearest chiasma on the
     * two opposing arm, but close to it and due to interference it is conflicting
     * (this can only occur when popdata.chiasmaInterference is true). In that
     * case no new chiasmata are generated for this arm, but the failed
     * chiasma defines the new start point of the chromosome exchange interval. 
     * Also no new chiasmata are generated in the arm with the interfering
     * chiasma - "reason 3" in testChiasma2
     * 2d. the new chiasma is generated beyond the position of a previous
     * conflicting chiasma as discussed in 2c, but not conflicting with
     * an actual chiasma. Then the start of the exchange interval is
     * moved to that position, which is also the end of the interval -
     * again "reason 2" in testChiasma2
     * The reasoning behind method 2 (a, b, c, d) is that in order to generate
     * a chiasma, even if it conflicts, the pairing of the chromosomes in that
     * arm must already have been completed up to that point or up to the 
     * chromosome exchange point.
     * 3. (implemented in testChiasma13):
     * Chiasmata are generated from the ends of each arm until the first
     * conflict occurs. When this happens the crossing-over process is
     * ended for the complete quadrivalent.
     * This seems to be too stringent: the amount of recombination at the
     * ends of the arms is about half that in a bivalent.
     * 
     * QUESTION: should the chromosome exchange point cause interference like
     * a chiasma? 
     * ANSWER: that depends on whether the interference is mainly caused by the
     * mechanical bending stress (then: yes) or mainly by the break/repair
     * process (then: no). But a practical consideration is that it is often
     * not precisely known where the exchange point is (based on genetics it
     * can only be located to between the two nearest opposing recombination 
     * points), so interference cannot be modelled.
     * Based on simulations with quadrimethod 2 (the default) and without 
     * chiasma interference we see no difference in recombination in small
     * intervals near head, center or tail of the chromosome, but in 200 CM
     * and 400 cM chromosomes we see more recombination in long segments
     * (from about 10% of total chromosome) around the center than at the ends.
     * Perhaps this reflects the more pronounced unimodal distribution of
     * the chromosome exchange point around the chromosome center in the
     * longer chromosomes?
     *
